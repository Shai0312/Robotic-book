# Implementation Tasks: Digital Twin with Gazebo and Unity

**Feature**: Digital Twin with Gazebo and Unity | **Branch**: 001-digital-twin-gazebo-unity | **Date**: 2025-12-17
**Spec**: [specs/001-digital-twin-gazebo-unity/spec.md](../001-digital-twin-gazebo-unity/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification with 3 prioritized user stories for educational content on Gazebo and Unity digital twin simulations

**Note**: This file is generated by the `/sp.tasks` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/tasks.md` for the execution workflow.

## Implementation Strategy

This implementation follows a spec-driven approach with documentation content organized in 3 chapters covering Gazebo and Unity simulations. The tasks are organized in phases to ensure proper dependency management and enable independent testing of each user story. The approach focuses on creating educational content that allows AI and Robotics students to learn about digital twin technology with physics simulation, environments, and sensors.

### MVP Approach
- **Phase 1-2**: Setup and foundational tasks
- **Phase 3**: User Story 1 (Physical Simulation with Gazebo) - Core MVP
- **Phase 4**: User Story 2 (Digital Twins and HRI in Unity) - Enhanced functionality
- **Phase 5**: User Story 3 (Sensor Simulation and Validation) - Complete feature set
- **Phase 6**: Polish and integration tasks

### Parallelization Strategy
Tasks marked with [P] can be executed in parallel as they work on different files/modules. User stories are designed to be independently testable with their own acceptance criteria.

## Dependencies

### User Story Completion Order
1. **User Story 1** (P1): Foundation for all other stories
2. **User Story 2** (P2): Builds on basic concepts but can be developed in parallel
3. **User Story 3** (P3): Dependent on basic simulation environments from stories 1 and 2

### Blocking Dependencies
- Setup and foundational tasks must complete before user story development
- Basic Docusaurus configuration needed before content creation
- Common documentation standards apply to all content

### User Story 2 (Digital Twins and HRI in Unity)
- [P] T035-T040: Create individual chapter-2 content files in parallel

### User Story 3 (Sensor Simulation and Validation)
- [P] T055-T060: Create individual sensor simulation docs in parallel
- [P] T061-T065: Create validation examples in parallel
