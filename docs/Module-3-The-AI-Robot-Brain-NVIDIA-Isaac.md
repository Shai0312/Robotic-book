# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

This module focuses on advanced AI perception and navigation capabilities for humanoid robots using NVIDIA's Isaac ecosystem. Students will learn about perception and training with Isaac Sim, hardware-accelerated perception with Isaac ROS, and navigation and planning for humanoid robots using Nav2.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Use NVIDIA Isaac Sim for advanced perception training and simulation
- Implement hardware-accelerated perception pipelines with Isaac ROS
- Configure and deploy Nav2 navigation for bipedal humanoid robots
- Integrate perception and navigation systems for autonomous humanoid operation
- Optimize AI models for real-time humanoid robot applications

## Target Audience

This module is designed for AI and Robotics students building humanoid robots with advanced perception and navigation capabilities.

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three main chapters:

1. **Perception and Training with NVIDIA Isaac Sim**: Advanced perception and training techniques
2. **Hardware-Accelerated Perception with Isaac ROS**: GPU-accelerated perception pipelines
3. **Navigation and Planning for Humanoid Robots (Nav2)**: Navigation and planning for bipedal systems

Each chapter builds upon the previous one, providing a comprehensive understanding of AI-powered robot brains using NVIDIA's Isaac platform.

## Chapter Navigation

The chapters in this module are available in the sidebar navigation. Follow them in sequence to build your understanding of AI-powered humanoid robot systems:

1. **Chapter 1**: Perception and Training with NVIDIA Isaac Sim - Advanced perception and training techniques using Isaac Sim
2. **Chapter 2**: Hardware-Accelerated Perception with Isaac ROS - GPU-accelerated perception pipelines with Isaac ROS
3. **Chapter 3**: Navigation and Planning for Humanoid Robots (Nav2) - Navigation and planning for bipedal systems

Each chapter builds upon the previous one, providing a comprehensive understanding of AI-powered robot brains using NVIDIA's Isaac platform.
