# ROS 2 Core Concepts

## Chapter Overview

Welcome to the ROS 2 Core Concepts chapter! This module introduces you to the fundamental building blocks of ROS 2, the middleware that connects AI agents to humanoid robot control systems. By the end of this chapter, you'll understand how ROS 2 enables complex robotic systems to communicate and coordinate effectively.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- Understand the core architecture of ROS 2 and its components
- Create and manage ROS 2 nodes using Python
- Implement publisher-subscriber communication patterns
- Use services for request-response communication
- Model data flow in humanoid robot systems
- Apply ROS 2 concepts to real-world humanoid robot scenarios

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, ensure you have:

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of object-oriented programming concepts
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts (optional but helpful)

## Chapter Contents

This chapter is organized into the following sections:

1. **Introduction to ROS 2** - Understanding what ROS 2 is and why it's essential for humanoid robots
2. **Nodes** - The fundamental building blocks of ROS 2 systems
3. **Topics and Messages** - Communication through publish-subscribe patterns
4. **Services** - Request-response communication patterns
5. **Data Flow in Humanoid Robots** - How ROS 2 enables coordination in complex robotic systems

Each section includes practical examples, code snippets, and exercises to reinforce your learning. Let's begin by exploring what ROS 2 is and why it's crucial for humanoid robot development.
