# ROS 2 Robot Control Module

## Welcome to the Educational Module

Welcome to the comprehensive educational module on ROS 2 Robot Control! This module is designed for AI engineers and robotics students with basic Python knowledge who want to understand how to connect AI agents to humanoid robot control systems.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will be able to:

- Understand fundamental ROS 2 concepts including nodes, topics, services, and messages
- Connect Python-based AI agents to robot control systems using rclpy
- Implement the agent → controller → actuator loop pattern
- Model humanoid robots using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Create complete robot descriptions with proper links, joints, and frames
- Validate and test URDF models for humanoid robots

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Understanding of fundamental programming concepts (variables, functions, classes)
- Basic understanding of 3D coordinate systems and transformations
- Familiarity with XML syntax (for URDF modeling)

## Module Structure

This educational module is organized into three main chapters:

### Chapter 1: ROS 2 Core Concepts
Learn about the fundamental concepts of ROS 2, including:
- Nodes and their role in robotics
- Topics and message passing
- Services for request-response communication
- Data flow in humanoid robots

### Chapter 2: Python-ROS Integration
Explore how to connect Python agents to robot control systems:
- Introduction to rclpy (Python client library for ROS 2)
- Creating ROS 2 nodes in Python
- Publishing and subscribing to topics
- Using services in Python
- Implementing the agent → controller → actuator loop

### Chapter 3: Humanoid Modeling with URDF
Master the art of modeling humanoid robots:
- Introduction to URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Creating links and joints for robot modeling
- Working with frames and transformations
- URDF as the robot's physical schema
- Practical humanoid model examples
- Validation rules and best practices

## Getting Started

If you're new to ROS 2, we recommend starting with the [Quick Start Guide](./quickstart.md) to set up your environment and get familiar with the basic concepts. Then proceed through the chapters in order, as each builds on the previous concepts.

For experienced users, you can jump directly to any chapter of interest, though you may need to refer back to earlier chapters for foundational concepts.

## Navigation Tips

- Use the sidebar to navigate between chapters and sections
- Each page includes exercises and practical examples
- Code examples are provided throughout the documentation
- The [Glossary](./glossary.md) provides definitions for key terms

## About This Module

This educational module was created using Docusaurus, a modern static website generator optimized for documentation. All content is structured as Markdown files with additional features for educational content, making it easy to maintain and extend.
