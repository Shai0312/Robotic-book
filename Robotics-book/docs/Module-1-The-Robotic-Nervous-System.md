# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) is designed to introduce ROS 2 as the middleware that connects AI agents to humanoid robot control. This module serves as the foundational component of the ROS 2 Robot Control Module educational series, specifically targeting AI engineers and robotics students with basic Python knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

After completing Module 1, students will be able to:

- Understand the core architecture of ROS 2 and its components
- Create and manage ROS 2 nodes using Python
- Implement publisher-subscriber communication patterns
- Use services for request-response communication
- Model data flow in humanoid robot systems
- Apply ROS 2 concepts to real-world humanoid robot scenarios

## Module Structure

Module 1 consists of the following chapters:

### Chapter 1: ROS 2 Core Concepts
- Introduction to ROS 2 and its importance for humanoid robots
- Understanding nodes as the fundamental building blocks
- Topics and messages for publish-subscribe communication
- Services for request-response patterns
- Data flow visualization in humanoid robot systems

### Chapter 2: Python Agents to Robot Control
- Introduction to rclpy fundamentals
- Creating the agent → controller → actuator loop
- Practical examples of Python-ROS integration
- Exercises for hands-on learning

### Chapter 3: Humanoid Modeling with URDF
- Understanding links and joints in URDF
- Frames and transformations for coordinate systems
- URDF as the robot's physical schema
- Practical examples and exercises

## Target Audience

This module is designed for:
- AI engineers looking to integrate with robotic systems
- Robotics students with basic Python knowledge
- Developers interested in middleware architectures
- Researchers working with humanoid robots

## Prerequisites

Students should have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of object-oriented programming concepts
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts (optional but helpful)

## Module Duration

Estimated completion time: 15-20 hours of study and practical work.

## Next Steps

After completing Module 1, students can proceed to Module 2 (Advanced Robot Control) and Module 3 (AI Integration with Humanoid Robots), where they'll build upon the foundational knowledge gained in this module.

## About This Module
