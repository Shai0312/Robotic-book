## Prompt

```
Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo and Unity ) Target Audience: -AI and Robotics student building simulating humanoid environments FOCUS: -physical-based simulation with Gazebo -high fadelity digital twins and HRI using unity -sensor simulation (LIDAR, DEPTH CAMERA, IMU) Structure (Docsaurus): -Chapter 1: Physical simulation with gazebo -Chapter 2: Digital twins and HRI in unity -Chapter 3:sensor simulation and validation -tech: Docsaurus (all files in.md)
```

## Response

Created a comprehensive feature specification for "Digital Twin with Gazebo and Unity" with:

1. User Stories prioritized for:
   - Physical Simulation with Gazebo (P1)
   - Digital Twins and HRI in Unity (P2)
   - Sensor Simulation and Validation (P3)

2. Functional Requirements covering:
   - Gazebo simulation environment
   - Unity digital twin creation
   - Sensor simulation (LIDAR, depth camera, IMU)
   - Educational content modules
   - HRI interfaces

3. Success Criteria with measurable outcomes for student learning and system performance

The specification addresses the target audience of AI and Robotics students building simulating humanoid environments with focus on physical-based simulation, high-fidelity digital twins, and sensor simulation validation.

## Outcome

Specification successfully created and ready for planning phase.

## Evaluation

The feature specification is complete with clear user stories, functional requirements, and success criteria. It aligns with the user's request for an educational module on digital twins using Gazebo and Unity with sensor simulation capabilities.
