## Prompt

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response

Generated comprehensive task list for the Digital Twin with Gazebo and Unity module with 6 phases:

1. Setup Phase (T001-T005): Project initialization and module directory creation
2. Foundational Phase (T010-T014): Common standards and formatting
3. User Story 1 Phase (T015-T020): Physical Simulation with Gazebo (P1 priority)
4. User Story 2 Phase (T025-T030): Digital Twins and HRI in Unity (P2 priority)
5. User Story 3 Phase (T035-T040): Sensor Simulation and Validation (P3 priority)
6. Polish Phase (T045-T054): Integration, validation, and final touches

The tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths. Tasks are organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing. Parallel execution opportunities are marked with [P] for efficient development.

## Outcome

Complete task breakdown ready for implementation with 32 specific, actionable tasks organized in priority order with proper dependencies and cross-cutting concerns addressed.

## Evaluation

All tasks follow the required format and enable the creation of the educational module as specified. Each user story has its own phase with independent test criteria and acceptance scenarios clearly defined.
