## Prompt

```
- Setup Module-2 in Docsaurus with structured chapters for Gazebo and unity simulations (phyics,environments,sensors). All content written as .md files,organized per chapter for eay navigation.
```

## Response

Completed the planning phase for the Digital Twin with Gazebo and Unity module with:

1. Implementation Plan (plan.md) - Outlined the technical approach, project structure, and constitution compliance
2. Research (research.md) - Analyzed Gazebo, Unity, and sensor simulation technologies for educational content
3. Data Model (data-model.md) - Defined the conceptual organization of information and learning content
4. Quickstart Guide (quickstart.md) - Created a rapid introduction to digital twin creation with Gazebo and Unity
5. Documentation Contract (contracts/documentation-contract.md) - Specified structure, content requirements, and quality standards

The planning ensures the module will be structured in 3 chapters as specified, with all content in .md format for Docusaurus, organized for easy navigation by AI and Robotics students.

## Outcome

Planning phase completed with all required artifacts created. Ready for task generation phase (/sp.tasks) to begin implementation of the documentation modules.

## Evaluation

All planning artifacts align with the specification and constitution requirements. The educational content structure supports the learning objectives for digital twin technology using Gazebo and Unity simulations.
