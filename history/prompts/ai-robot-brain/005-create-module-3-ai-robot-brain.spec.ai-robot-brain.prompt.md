# Prompt History Record: Create Module 3 AI-Robot Brain Documentation

## PROMPT_TEXT

You are an expert AI robotics educator.

Write "Module 3: The AI–Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)" for a robotics textbook aimed at AI and Robotics students building humanoid robots.

Style:
- Technical and concise
- Graduate / advanced undergraduate level
- No marketing language
- Docusaurus documentation
- Markdown (.md) only

Focus:
- Advanced perception and training
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- Isaac ROS
- Visual SLAM (VSLAM)
- Nav2 navigation for bipedal humanoids
you write chapter 3Chapters:
1. Perception and Training with NVIDIA Isaac Sim
2. Hardware-Accelerated Perception with Isaac ROS
3. Navigation and Planning for Humanoid Robots (Nav2)

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Successfully created Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) with three comprehensive chapters:
1. Chapter 1: Perception and Training with NVIDIA Isaac Sim
2. Chapter 2: Hardware-Accelerated Perception with Isaac ROS
3. Chapter 3: Navigation and Planning for Humanoid Robots (Nav2)

Also updated the sidebar navigation to include the new module with proper hierarchical structure, and created a specification document for the feature.

## OUTCOME

The Module 3 documentation has been successfully created with all three required chapters, each containing detailed technical content appropriate for graduate/advanced undergraduate level students. The content covers NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2 navigation for humanoid robots as requested. The documentation integrates properly with the existing structure and is accessible through the navigation system.

## EVALUATION

The implementation successfully addresses all requirements:
- ✓ Technical and concise content at appropriate academic level
- ✓ Focus on NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem (Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, VSLAM)
- ✓ Nav2 navigation for bipedal humanoids covered
- ✓ Three comprehensive chapters created
- ✓ Proper integration with existing documentation structure
- ✓ Docusaurus-compatible markdown format
