# Module 4 VLA Planning

## PROMPT_TEXT

/sp.plan

Module: Module 4 – Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Objective:
Build an end-to-end VLA system where a simulated robot converts voice commands into planned, perceptive, and physical actions.

Execution plan:
1. Introduce Voice-to-Action pipelines using speech-to-text and ROS 2
2. Implement LLM-based cognitive planning from natural language goals
3. Integrate voice, planning, vision, navigation, and manipulation into a humanoid capstone

Deliverables:
- 3 instructional chapters
- Each chapter delivered as a standalone Docusaurus-compatible Markdown (.md) file
- Runnable Python + ROS 2 examples using simulation

Milestones:
- Chapter 1: Voice command triggers robot behavior
- Chapter 2: LLM generates and executes action plans
- Chapter 3: Full autonomous humanoid pipeline demonstrated

Constraints:
- Python and ROS 2 only
- Simulation-based
- No hardware deployment or ethics discussion
you also write prompt history record also add in specs in module-4-vision-language-action and
create plan.md file.                                                   why website is not appeared?

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created implementation plan for Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA) with complete technical context, architecture overview, and implementation milestones. The plan includes:
- Technical context with architecture overview and technology stack
- Constitution check with quality standards
- Phase 0 research tasks
- Phase 1 design with component specifications
- Phase 2 implementation plan with milestones
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Success criteria (quantitative and qualitative)
- Implementation timeline

The plan covers all three chapters: Voice-to-Action, Cognitive Planning with LLMs, and Capstone Autonomous Humanoid integration. All components are designed for simulation-based testing with Python and ROS 2 only as requested.
