# Module 4 VLA Tasks

## PROMPT_TEXT

/sp.tasks
$ARGUMENTS

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created implementation tasks for Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA) with complete task breakdown organized by priority phases. The tasks document includes:

- Phase 1: Setup (environment and dependencies)
- Phase 2: Foundational (core VLA architecture)
- Phase 3: Chapter 1 - Voice-to-Action implementation
- Phase 4: Chapter 2 - Cognitive Planning with LLMs implementation
- Phase 5: Chapter 3 - Capstone Autonomous Humanoid integration
- Phase 6: Validation and Testing

Each phase contains detailed, testable tasks with priority levels and references to the corresponding documentation files. All tasks are designed to support the implementation of the complete VLA pipeline with voice recognition, cognitive planning, and action execution in simulation.
